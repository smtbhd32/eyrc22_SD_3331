Hi...
Algorithm used for Feature Detection: SIFT Algorithm

Procedure for Georeferencing: I'm using python subprocess module to run command like gdal_translate and gdal_wrap
Firstly I'm getting the long and latitude of GCPs using lat long function shown in briefing provided... Then creating a string for command and running it using shlex and subprocess modules.

Instructions for running the scripts:

Firstly, we will run qgis_display.py... Steps for that:
1. I'm using CSV method for plotting objects... For that you have to create a csv file named plot.csv with format "id,Longitude,Latitude" and one sample data...
2. Then you have to update the address of csv file in uri variable present in line 33 of file qgis_display.py file...
3. Open qgis with OpenStreetMap as base layer, recommende coordinate system EPSG:4326
4. Using Python plugin, run updated Qgis_diaplay.py file....

Secondly, we will run submission file... stepls for that:
1. You have to update the directory of task2d.tiff file... For that update the self.address variable in line 54 of block_locator.py file with updated address...
2. Then you are good to go... Run the block_locator.py file using rosrun command...
